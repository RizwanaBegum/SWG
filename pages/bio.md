# About

A static site generator is a build tool. The Static page generators are convenient when developing simple websites/pages. The static page generator takes content, applies it to the template and generates a static HTML file to serve to the browser.

### Why use them?  
- Fast load times.  

Having to dynamically pull information from a database every time a visitor hits a page on a content-heavy site can result in delays that cause frustration and bounces.

SSGs serve already compiled files to the browser, cutting load times by a large margin.

-  Security & reliability  

One of the biggest threats of developing with a dynamic CMS is the lack of security. Their need for bigger server-side infrastructures opens the way for potential breaches.

With static setups, there's little to no server-side functionality.

- Flexibility  

Opinionated and cumbersome traditional CMSs are constraining. The only way to scale is with existing plugins and customization is limited to available theming platforms. That's cool if you're a non-technical user, but developers quickly find themselves hands tied.

SSGs might ask for more technical skills but will reward developers with freedom. Most of them also have plugin ecosystems, theming and easy to plug third-party services. Plus, extendability using their core programming language is limitless.
