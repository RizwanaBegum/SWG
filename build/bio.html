      <h1>About</h1>
<p>A static site generator is a build tool. The Static page generators are convenient when developing simple websites/pages. The static page generator takes content, applies it to the template and generates a static HTML file to serve to the browser.</p>
<h3>Why use them?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fast load times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having to dynamically pull information from a database every time a visitor hits a page on a content-heavy site can result in delays that cause frustration and bounces.</p>
<p>SSGs serve already compiled files to the browser, cutting load times by a large margin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Security &amp; reliability</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the biggest threats of developing with a dynamic CMS is the lack of security. Their need for bigger server-side infrastructures opens the way for potential breaches.</p>
<p>With static setups, there's little to no server-side functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Opinionated and cumbersome traditional CMSs are constraining. The only way to scale is with existing plugins and customization is limited to available theming platforms. That's cool if you're a non-technical user, but developers quickly find themselves hands tied.</p>
<p>SSGs might ask for more technical skills but will reward developers with freedom. Most of them also have plugin ecosystems, theming and easy to plug third-party services. Plus, extendability using their core programming language is limitless.</p>
